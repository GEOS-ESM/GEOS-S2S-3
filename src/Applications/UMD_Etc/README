ODAS UPDATE FOR MILAN
=====================

Problems:
===========
1. Given the pagepool memory limitation in SLES17,
python observer code overloaded the memory resulting
in a staling of the job with no progress. The problem
was caused by the code loading full datafiles in memory
via numpy arrays.

2. Users without prioritty could not complete jobs
as observer jobs in queue often cuased the main job 
run out of time.

3. Expected behavior of model BOMBING when ADT sigo variance
is bellow a threshold. The user would have to either correct
altimeter observations, or remove the problematic altimeter
for the cycle, and resubmit for one cycle.

4. Hardcoded path dependencies for utilities like ncap2 and
mpi4py require code modification every time a software change
is implemented.

Solutions:
===========
1. Xarray paralelized lazy operations were implemented
to replace numpy array operations:

UMD_utils/ocean_obs.py replaces old code stored as 
UMD_utils/ocean_obs.legacy.py

Legacy is conserved because new xarray reader where not 
implemented for some legacy observer readers.
New reader might be implemented as needed.

2. The IN_LINE environmental variable set in
ocean_das_config when set to True, allows for observers to
be executed within the same job. This option is slower than
spawning multiple observer jobs, but in the long run minimizes
queue wait times for users.
NOTE: IN_LINE=False (old configuration) should not be used 
on Milan nodes due to cpu per node quota.

scripts/oda_run.j replaces old code stored as
scripts/oda_run.legacy.j

scripts/ocean_observer.py replaces old code stored as
scripts/ocean_observer.legacy.py

3. An option BOMB_ON_SIGO was implemented in ocean_das_config
so when set to false, it will skip the altimeter data for
the single observer, while conserving the ADT obs for the 
rest of the cycle. BOMB_ON_SIGO default is set to True,
to be kept for observation people to correct observation
files.

4. Hard coded paths where removed and new modules were
aded to g5_modules.
