In the repository, this directory contains only this README file.

Put the destination (new) .til file for
which we are creating restarts in this directory and
the old restarts in ../InData,
and then run mk_Restarts from the
parent directory (mk_restarts). 

You have to be aware whether the .til your a putting here
is consistent with the new Pfafstteter data. See comments in InData/README.

See the READMEs in .. and ../InData.

The five restarts for landice, lake, salt, vegdyn, and catch will be
created here, as well as albedo files, an lai-greeness 12-month climatology
and a vegdyn restart, all of which the model reads on the land tiles.

Do not add anything to the repository.
