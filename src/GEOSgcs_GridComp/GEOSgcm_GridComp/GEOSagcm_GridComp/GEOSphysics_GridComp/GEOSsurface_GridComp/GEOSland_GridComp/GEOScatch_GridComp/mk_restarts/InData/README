In the repository, this directory contains this README and the surface
property data for the Pfafstetter catchments.

If you are running with a destination .til file that is consistent
with the archived Pfaffstteter data (Cubed fortuna tags and later),
update this directory to the head to make sure you have all those
data files in your sandbox. If you are working with an earlier 
.til file, make sure those files ARE NOT in the sand box. In this case
you will need to put files laigrn.data nirdf.dat and vis.dat from 
the source run. 

In all cases, you will need to put the four 
(landice,lake,salt, and catch) source restarts and the
corresponding .til file in this directory.

The destination .til goes in ../OutData

You can then run mk_Restarts from the parent directory
(mk_restarts).

See the READMEs in .. and ../OutData.

Do not add anything to the repository.
