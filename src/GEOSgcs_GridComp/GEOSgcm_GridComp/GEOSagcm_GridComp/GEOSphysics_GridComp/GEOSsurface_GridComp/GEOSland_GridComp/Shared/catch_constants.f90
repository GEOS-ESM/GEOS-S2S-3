module catch_constants

  ! reichle+koster, 2007
  ! reichle, 10 Oct 2008 - added "echo_catch_constants()"
  ! reichle, 28 Oct 2010 - moved DZ, SHR, PHI, FSN from subroutines gndtp0() and gndtmp()
  !                      - moved FWETL, FWETC from subroutine interc()
  !                      - renamed N_gndtmp -> N_gt
  ! reichle, 23 Nov 2010 - replaced PHIGT with POROS(N), ALHMGT with ALHM
  !                      - replaced constants with values from MAPL_Constants.F90
  !                        where possible
  ! reichle, 30 Nov 2010 - zero-diff revisions and clean-up for off-line (land-only) MERRA
  !                        replay capability
  !                         - restored PHIGT, ALHMGT 
  !                         - moved MIN_SNOW_MASS->MINSWE, DZ1MAX, and SATCAPFR to 
  !                            catch_constants
  !                         - moved "small" back from catch_constants() into snowrt()
  ! reichle, 14 Aug 2014 - moved constants that are only needed in subroutine catchment() 
  !                         to catchment.F90 where they are now private to the F90 module 
  !                         "catchment_model"
  !                      - removed all constants that come straight from MAPL_Constants
  !                      - renamed all remaining public constants by prefacing with "catch_*"
  !                      - moved "echo_catch_constants()" to catchment.F90 (and renamed)
  ! Sarith, 10 Nov 2015  - moved SHR, EPSILON, SCONST, CSOIL_1,  CSOIL_2, N_sm, and SATCAPFR here
  !                        from land models.
  !                      - added routing model constants  N_Pfafs_LandCatchs and N_Pfaf_Catchs
