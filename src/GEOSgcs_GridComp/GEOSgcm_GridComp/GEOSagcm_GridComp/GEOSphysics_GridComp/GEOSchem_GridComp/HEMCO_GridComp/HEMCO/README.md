hemco_standalone
================

This is the HEMCO standalone model environment. It contains all additional routines to run HEMCO in standalone mode. The HEMCO
source code (https://github.com/christophkeller/hemco) needs to be included separately.
Installation requires links to the GEOS-Chem netCDF libraries. An example Makefile that includes automatic download of all HEMCO
codes and the GEOS-Chem netCDF library can be found at https://github.com/christophkeller/hemco_standalone_full.
