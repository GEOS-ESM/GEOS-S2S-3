TIMEZONES (i.e. OFFSETS FROM UTC) WERE COMPUTED FROM LONGITUDE
HEMCO WARNING: Surface pressure PSFC uniformly set to 101325 Pa! This may affect the accuracy of vertical grid quantities. It is recommended you provide PSFC via the model-HEMCO interface or the HEMCO configuration file!

HEMCO WARNING: Cannot set surface height ZSFC. This may cause some extensions to fail. HEMCO tries to calculate ZSFC from surface pressure and air temperature, but at least one of these variables seem to be missing.

HEMCO WARNING: Cannot set boxheights BXHEIGHT_M. This may cause some extensions to fail. HEMCO tries to calculate BXHEIGHT from pressure edges and air temperature, but at least one of these variables seem to be missing.
