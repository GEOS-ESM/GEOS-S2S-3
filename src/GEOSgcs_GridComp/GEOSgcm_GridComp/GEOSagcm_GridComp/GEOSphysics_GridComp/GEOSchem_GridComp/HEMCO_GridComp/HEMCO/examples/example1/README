This folder contains example data for a HEMCO standalone run where global NO emissions are calculated from the HTAP emission inventory, overlaid by EMEP emissions. 

You can run this example by calling the hemco_standalone executable 'hemco_standalone.x' from within this directory:
./hemco_standalone.x "HEMCO_sa_Config.rc"

If successfully executed, the HEMCO logfile (HEMCO_sa.log) and diagnostics file (HEMCO_sa.diagnostics.YYYYMMDDhhmm.nc) are written to the output directory.

This folder should contain:
- HEMCO_sa_Config.rc             : HEMCO configuration file
- HEMCO_sa_Diagn.rc              : Output diagnostics definition 
- HEMCO_sa_Grid.rc               : Emission grid definition
- HEMCO_sa_Spec.rc               : Species definition
- HEMCO_sa_Time.rc               : Time and date specifications
- output/                        : Directory with output data
